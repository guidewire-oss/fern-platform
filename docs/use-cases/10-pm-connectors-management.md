# PM Connectors Management Use Cases

## Overview

PM (Project Management) Connectors enable seamless integration between Fern Platform and external project management tools like JIRA, GitHub Issues, Azure DevOps, and Aha!. These connectors allow teams to link test results with requirements, user stories, and bug reports, providing end-to-end traceability from requirements to test execution.

## Actors

- **Admin**: A user with administrative privileges who can create and manage PM connectors
- **Manager**: A user who can configure PM links for their team's projects
- **Team Member**: A user who can view PM links and use labels to associate tests with PM items
- **System**: The Fern Platform backend and PM connector services

## Prerequisites

- User must be authenticated (see [00-authentication.md](./00-authentication.md))
- For connector management: User must have admin role
- For project PM links: User must have manager role for the project
- External PM tool must be accessible from Fern Platform
- Valid credentials for the external PM tool
